 DXRD_Release

This program was originally named "HXRD", but now is renamed "DXRD" (standing for "Dynamical X-Ray Diffraction"). The program is only for Windows OS. You only need to download all the files (Click "<> Code" above and then click "Download ZIP") and copy/unzip them in a folder in your computer. Then go to the folder and click the "DXRD.exe" file to run the program. No installation is necessary. Keep the sub-folder "f0f1f2" directly under the main folder (just don't make any changes to this subfolder).
